# Shop

"Shop" is one of my first programs coded during my C++ courses.The program simulates the basic accounting transactions - 
buying, selling, shop balance accounting, also few additional functions with product list - sorting by several parameters, 
finding products in a list by different parameters, adding, deleting products. 

Shop program designed for operating with different product categories and differing product parametes. 
New product category can be always added by including dll file into program directory. "FlowerShop" folder contains main program,
"AliveProductDLL" folder contains example of dll file, which describes such category of products as "flowers".
